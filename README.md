<p>By taking the <em>Advanced CSS and SASS</em> course developed by <strong>Jonas Schmedtmann</strong>, I acquired a vast array of modern CSS techniques, enabling me to comprehend deeply how CSS works behind the scenes, including the cascade, specificity, inheritance, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have become proficient in utilizing two powerful CSS tools, Flexbox and Grid, which permit unparalleled levels of customization in contemporary web design. I am also skilled in advanced responsive design techniques, such as media queries, mobile-first vs desktop-first, em VS rem units, and much more.</p>
<p>Animating a website with CSS is what I enjoy the most, and with this course, I learned various techniques using <strong>@keyframes, animation, and transition.</strong></p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Despite the fact that the Jonas Schmedtmann course primarily focuses on HTML, CSS, and SASS, I chose to develop my project using <strong>React.js.</strong></p>
<p>What I appreciate most about <strong>React.js</strong> is its flexibility due to its modular structure and high performance. The framework's core offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes even complex applications run smoothly. Moreover, I find the reusable components of <strong>React.js</strong> to be highly efficient and capable of saving considerable production time.</p>
