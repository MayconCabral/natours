<p>Through the course <em>Advanced CSS and SASS</em> created by <em>Jonas Schmedtmann</em>, I could learn tons of modern CSS techniques, deeply understand how CSS works behind the scenes: <em>the cascade, specificity, inheritance, etc.</em></p>
<p>Also be able to use the two powerful CSS tools - <em>Flexbox and Grid</em> - that allow for a unique level of customization in modern web design, with an advanced responsive desing, such as <em>media queries, mobile-first vs desktop-first, em vs rem, unit</em> and much more.</p>
<p>Bring life to a website with CSS animation is what I like most! With this course I could learn more possibilities using <em>@keyframes, animation and transition</em>.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>I decided to make this project with <strong>React.Js</strong>, although the <em>Jonas Schmedtmann</em> course is focus on <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>SASS</strong>.</p>
<p>I like <strong>React.Js</strong> for its flexibility due to its modular structure with the high performance - <em>the core of the framework offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering </em>- which makes complex apps run fast. I enjoy the <strong>React.Js</strong> reusable components with the potencial to save what is the most important in our days life: <strong><em>Time</em></strong>.</p>
